SVG-cards 1.1
-------------

This is a set of playing cards made in pure SVG with all kings, queens, jacks, numbers, jokers and backs of cards. This set of SVG files is intended to be used in games, figures, illustrations, web sites as long as you provide the code source and the LGPL license (see the COPYING file). Although this is a free software, the license is the LGPL so you can use this set of cards even in a non-free software.

The kings, queens and jacks are based on the french representation, because I find them beautiful. The name on the side of the characters' cards are fictious and traditionnal. Sometimes they refer to a real of legendary character, sometimes not really. You'll find Lancelot, Cesar (Caesar), Alexandre (Alexander) and David and so on...

The characters are in french and in english. As I'm not sure if librsvg, xsvg, and other svg parsers are able to deal with locale and css, and due to the different positions of letters, I duplicated all cards so that to have french and english cards as well. The frenchi cards are suffixed by _fr and the english one by _en.

These cards have been made with GNOME games in mind and have been succesfully tested with Nautilus, Eye of Gnome (both of them use librsvg) and Inkscape.
To draw them, Adobe Illustrator, Gimp (!) and Autotrace were my main tools. My wife, Brigitte, lovely designed most of the most complicated backs of cards with xfig and Inkscape.

Enjoy!
